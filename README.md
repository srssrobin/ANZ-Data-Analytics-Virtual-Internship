ANZ Data Analytics Virtual Internship

Task 1: 
1. Data Preparation and Insights: Load the transaction dataset and perform basic checks for any data issues or cleaning needs. Gather key insights such as the average transaction amount and the average number of transactions per customer each month.

2. Transaction Trends and Time Analysis: Segment the dataset by transaction date and time. Visualize transaction volume and spending patterns over a typical day or week, and account for any outliers that could distort the analysis.

3. Identifying Potential Fraud: Leverage location information to identify unusual patterns or outliers that may indicate fraudulent transactions. Look for abnormal spending behaviors, such as high-value transactions in unusual locations or times.
