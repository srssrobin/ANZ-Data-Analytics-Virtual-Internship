ANZ Data Analytics Virtual Internship

## Task 1: 
1. **Data Preparation and Insights**: Load the transaction dataset and perform basic checks for any data issues or cleaning needs. Gather key insights such as the average transaction amount and the average number of transactions per customer each month.

2. **Transaction Trends and Time Analysis**: Segment the dataset by transaction date and time. Visualize transaction volume and spending patterns over a typical day or week, and account for any outliers that could distort the analysis.

3. **Identifying Potential Fraud**: Leverage location information to identify unusual patterns or outliers that may indicate fraudulent transactions. Look for abnormal spending behaviors, such as high-value transactions in unusual locations or times.


## Task 2:
1. **Data Exploration and Feature Identification**: Analyze the `transactions_edited` dataset to explore customer attributes (such as age, gender, and purchase behavior) and their correlations with annual salary. Visualize significant relationships using scatter plots.

2. **Predictive Modelling with Linear Regression**: Build a Linear Regression model to predict annual salary based on identified attributes and assess its accuracy for customer segmentation.

3. **Advanced Modelling with Decision Trees**: As a challenge, construct a Decision Tree model to predict salary and compare its performance with the Linear Regression model, discussing testing methods for evaluation.
